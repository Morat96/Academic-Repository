Description:
Homeworks based. Efficient computation of the word count problem using Map Reduce. Implementation of the k-means++ algorithm, adjusting centroids using an implemented version of Lloyd's algorithm. K-median as objective function is used. Efficient implementation of the previous algorithms using Map Reduce. Running on a very big dataset (physics dataset, 5GB) using cloud computing.
